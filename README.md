## Project Description

#### The Problem

There’s a ton of information out there in the medical world. Hospitals and clinics each have many of their own processes and specializations, making the search for specific information online quite difficult and time consuming. Health and wellness is crucial, so we want the most accurate and relevant information.

#### The Solution

With the help of LLM’s like the ones from OpenAI, we can create a web chatbot that is trained on data (website content, patient reviews, medical practices) about specific medical clinics and hospitals. This helps to provide the most relevant and accurate information to patients quickly, expediting the process of finding medical information online. This repository in particular is a demonstration of how a chatbot could be overlayed on a clinic website. 

#### Our Demo

Our good friends over at Ma's Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine graciously allowed us to utilize their clinic's online presence in our demonstration. You can visit their clinic's website at https://acupuncturema.com/
