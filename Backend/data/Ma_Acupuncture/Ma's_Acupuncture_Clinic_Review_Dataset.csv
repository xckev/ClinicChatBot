Dr. Shouchun Ma's help in my recovery of COVID-19 pneumonia

On March 13th, I returned to Phoenix from Europe where the COVID-19 epidemic was quickly spreading. After a day at home I began experiencing chest pain, fever and shortness of breath. A week after getting tested, the results confirmed I was positive for COVID-19. On the morning of March 24, symptoms were getting increasingly worse. My fever reached 102 degrees; my blood oxygen levels were 89mmHg. It was becoming harder for me to breathe and my fatigue and chest tightness were at an all-time high.  I went back to the hospital for the fourth time hoping to get some relief of symptoms. As I was sitting in the hospital room, fighting the COVID-19 virus, I immediately thought the reach out to Dr. Ma. As a Traditional Chinese Medical doctor, myself, I knew that I Dr. Ma, being one of the top Traditional Chinese Medical doctors in the country, would be able to help me get through my symptoms.

For over a month, Dr. Ma tirelessly worked with me to create a personalized treatment plan. Through using tongue diagnosis, checking my fever and blood oxygen levels, and closely monitoring my symptoms, he was able to help me improve my lung function and reach a full recovery. I knew that reaching out to an expert such as Dr. Ma would be essential in recovering from COVID-19 and my body is now fully recovered.

On March 24th I began to have more symptoms due to the Coronavirus infection. I had large amounts of erythema on both thighs and then in mid-April my knees began to flake and become severely dry. After consulting with Fang Yihan, a well-known dermatologist of traditional Chinese medicine in Los Angeles, she believed that similar to the skin disease caused by the Kawasaki virus, the new coronavirus, like many other viruses, can cause different symptoms to the skin. My symptoms now included skin issues as well as fatigue, hair loss, dry cough, and the occasional wet mucus cough. I once again sought out the help of Dr. Ma to help relieve my symptoms.

Dr. Ma believed that while the problem presented itself on the skin and through hair loss, it originated in the lungs. He said that the skin may only return to normal once the lung function is once again balanced. If the focus is only on the skin and hair loss, the root of the problem will not be solved. Treating the lungs and intestines and removing blood stasis will relieve the symptoms such as the cough and phlegm. In addition, the lungs will become more protected and nourished, the heart will be fully supported, and the root of the problem will be solved. He recommended that I take ""Qianjin Fang"", ""Zhi Chou San"", ""Er Chen Tang"", and ""Sheng Mai San"". I began taking the personalized treatment plan last night and when I woke up this morning, I didn't have any issues with my throat and currently have no symptoms of a cough.

Dr. Ma's superb medical skills, professionalism, and meticulous attitude left a deep impression on me. I want to showcase my deep gratitude for the doctor's kindness during this hard time. I wish him nothing but happiness, health, and peace! I have looked up to him since I was a teenager and am so glad that I was not only given the opportunity to meet him late last year in Seattle, but that he was able to help me feel better.

Seattle, WA","After trying physical therapy, pain medications, and ultimately having back surgery, I thought I was resigned to daily back pain for the rest of my life. Then, I found Ma's Acupuncture about 6 months ago.

I felt immediately better the second I got up from the table after my first session with Dr. LanLi, and have been coming back regularly since. Most recently, I had a flare up with the cold weather than has made it hard for me to walk. Dr. Ma has been determined to help me feel better, and is able to to so each time.

I can not recommend seeing her enough. Not only is she incredibly skilled, but she is also very kind, and flexible with changing work schedules.

Seattle, WA","My medical situation has always been complicated because an early childhood trauma and complicating family drama resulted in asthma, emotional weakness, and a mild form of autism while that same trauma resulted in my pushing myself with physical and emotional demands.  As a result I seemed powerful to others while, at the same time, was exhausting my immune system to the extreme. Western medicine complicated these problems and I began seeking acupuncture for treatment about 10 years ago.  
It was certainly helpful, but when loss and disappointment became extreme I found myself beyond the help of the younger (and certainly dedicated) Chinese medicine practitioners I saw.  
I have seen Dr. Ma, now, for 5 months with recognizable results from each visit.  Supporting his acupuncture treatments, his recommendations to me -- surprisingly simple yet profound -- have given me a peace of mind and physical confidence previously unknown to me.  Dr Ma is internationally respected for his teaching and conferences. As a physician of western medicine -- formerly practicing community psychiatry with a neurobiological emphasis -- I believe Dr. Ma's many years of experience and his dedication to teaching his craft give him an  unusual insight into the human condition.",5,,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mas-acupuncture-and-chinese-medicine-center-seattle?hrid=7FKn45S_R50allpvXIuZkQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)

Bellevue, WA","A+++ for Dr. LanLi Ma from Ma's Acupuncture & Chinese Medicine.  I was so lucky they opened a 2nd practice in Bellevue 1 months before I suffered excruciating pain caused by a pinched nerve in my shoulder blade.  

Initially I thought I had pulled a muscle.  However, after a few days I realized it was much more serious when the pain radiated/moved from my shoulder blade over my shoulder into my arm/hand and chest.  I took too much ibuprofen because it didn't help and I could not sleep because of the excruciating pain.  

I arrived for my first visit with a sick stomach from too much ibuprofen and exhausted/frazzled from pain and lack of sleep.  After my first treatment, my stomach felt great and the pain in my arm was gone. It was a miracle.  The pain did return after I got home but that night I slept like a puppy and the next morning all pain was gone.  It took 2 visits/week for 2 weeks but by my 5th visit the pain was permanently gone.  

Dr. LanLi Ma is fabulous, the clinic is clean, the people at the front desk are friendly and professional.  I can highly recommend Ma's Acupuncture & Chinese Medicine.",5,,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mas-acupuncture-and-chinese-medicine-center-seattle?hrid=wMfKNT7QzugzOWW81_PRug&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)

Seattle, WA","This review is very late in coming, but it is heartfelt.  My daughter was 13 years old.  She has a very weak immune system.  She had pneumonia, and it was getting worse, in spite of our seeing another acupuncturist in town.  She'd been ill for two weeks, was home from school, was resting (sleep was nearly impossible) at a 45 degree angle in the family room, with me nearby on the futon.  Her breathing was getting worse, not better, and she had begun to run a temperature.  We were terrified.

Enter Dr. Ma.  He saw our daughter, got her started on acupuncture and Chinese herbs.  He told us that she would sleep through the night that night and all subsequent nights, and that her fever would be gone by morning and would not return.  We were skeptical, but events unfolded exactly as he said they would.  Our daughter also felt stronger the next day, but she continued to cough over some months.  Acupuncture helped, but clearing out the lungs after pneumonia apparently takes time.  Our daughter recovered completely, and Dr. Ma helped her when no one else was able to do so.  WE LOVE HIM, and we see him whenever we need to.  Wonderful doctor, caring and kind person.",5,,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mas-acupuncture-and-chinese-medicine-center-seattle?hrid=3Hkh0UAOg-meT9yk4G0j6w&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)

Seattle, WA","Dr. Ma is the best, kindest, and most professional doctor I've ever known.  He truly cares about his patients, and does everything possible to help with their pain issues, and long term healing.  I was in an accident, and fell directly on, and crushed my tailbone area.  The MRI imaging showed  multiple compression fractures, and herniated discs.  I had  ""pain shocks""  radiating all through my body every time I tried to bend over, or lay down.

Thanks to Dr. Ma, the unbearable pain from deep in my lower spinal column has been greatly reduced, and I'm so thankful to this great and wonderful man.  Dr. Ma and his unique Acupuncture Techniques;  is, and continues to be the best road to recovery for me.  I feel lucky to have met him, and even more lucky to be his patient.

After 7 months of trying to find out why, I received an email in memory of Gilda Radnor warning that if this ever happened to you, get checked for Ovarian Cancer.  I finally had my answer.

Days later I had the good fortune to be told about Dr. Ma in Seattle.  I live in Spokane.  We immediately called and made an appointment., and because of the seriousness and because of being given 15 months to live,  we drove to Seattle once a week before chemo for a treatment from Dr. Ma.   It is now ten years later and I am still alive, and cancer free.  I give Dr. Ma the credit for me still being here today.   Not only am I still alive, but for the last 4 years I have been raisng a little Granddaughter, who is now 5 years old.  

Thank you Dr. Ma.   So happy that I here for this sweet little girl.

Phase 1: Cough, improved after a week of medication.
Phase 2: Constipation, also greatly improved after treatment.
Current stage: Frequent itching and eczema on the legs, currently improving.
Overall, her complexion is better than before, she has more energy, and she is currently undergoing treatment and dietary guidance from Dr. Ma, while also maintaining daily exercise, feeling better and better. Thank you very much, Dr. Ma, for the significant improvements in my mother's health brought about by your excellent medical skills! In fact, my mother's eczema is just the manifestation, she has underlying conditions such as high blood sugar and hypertension. At one point, she also had high urinary protein levels and did not receive good treatment in China. When she came, the eczema was very severe, accompanied by cough, constipation, mental weariness, lack of appetite, and such complex conditions. The current improvements in all aspects are not easy. So Dr. Ma is really amazing! Truly admire Dr. Ma's medical skills!

wechat,8/7/2021,Qiu. Q ,"For over 30 years, I had frequent pain under my right rib, but the cause couldn't be found. In the past 5-6 years, the pain became more severe, especially waking up in pain at night. I had multiple examinations in China and the United States but no cause was found. The Western doctors in both China and the United States thought I might have depression and prescribed antidepressants for me to try. However, my family and friends did not agree with me trying them, as they believed once I started, I wouldn't be able to stop. They suggested that I try Chinese medicine instead. I found Dr. Ma, explained my condition, and after a few weeks of acupuncture and herbal medicine, I felt much better. I have had intermittent visits with Dr. Ma, with some relapses in between, but the pain is not as severe as before. 
Recently, I have continued to receive acupuncture and take herbal medicine, and the pain under my right rib only occurs occasionally. Now I fully believe that this decades-long pain can be completely cured. 
Due to my age, I also have severe osteoporosis, joint pain, poor sleep, and blocked blood vessels, all of which have improved to some extent through Dr. Ma's treatment. Here, I thank Dr. Ma for his patient, careful, and meticulous work attitude; I admire Dr. Ma's superb medical skills; and I appreciate Dr. Ma's consideration of long-term health for the patients in formulating treatment plans.
